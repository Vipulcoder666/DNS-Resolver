##  Features

- Forward Lookup (Domain → IP Address)
- Reverse Lookup (IP → Domain Name)
- DNS response time measurement
- Proper error handling for invalid domains

---

##  Tech Stack

- Python
- Socket Programming
- Basic Networking (DNS, TCP/IP)

  ---

##  Concepts Covered

- DNS resolution process
- Client-server communication
- Socket programming
- Exception handling

---

##  Purpose

This project demonstrates practical understanding of how DNS translates domain names into IP addresses and how networking applications interact with system-level DNS services.
